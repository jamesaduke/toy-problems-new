# You are in charge of the cake for your niece's birthday and have decided the cake will have one candle for each
# year of her total age. When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones. Your task
# is to find out how many candles she can successfully blow out.
#
# For example, if your niece is turning 4 years old, and the cake will have 4 candles of height 4,4 ,1 ,3 , she will be
# able to blow out 2 candles successfully, since the tallest candles are of height 4 and there are 2 such candles.
#
# Function Description

# Complete the function birthdayCakeCandles in the editor below. It must return an integer representing the number of
# candles she can blow out.
#
# birthdayCakeCandles has the following parameter(s):
#
# ar: an array of integers representing candle heights


def birthdaycakecandles(ar):
    count = 0
    # maximum of the array
    maximum = max(ar)
    for i in range(len(ar)):
        if ar[i] == maximum:
            count += 1
    return count
